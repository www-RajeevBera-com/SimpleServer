# SimpleServer Solution

## Overview
The **SimpleServer** solution contains two main components:
1. **SimpleServeGUI**: A Windows Forms-based application that allows users to select a path for their static website, choose a port, and launch the web server with a simple graphical interface.
2. **SimpleServerConsole**: A console-based application that hosts a simple HTTP server to serve static files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The solution also includes a test site with some sample HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that can be used to test the server functionality.

## Features
- **GUI Web Server Launcher**: Launch a web server using a graphical interface where you can select your website folder and specify the port number.
- **Console Web Server**: A basic HTTP server to serve static files and provide insight into how web servers work.
- **Test Site**: A basic test website containing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to use with the server.

## Test Site
The `test-site` folder includes a simple HTML site to demonstrate the web server functionality. It consists of four files:
- `index.html`
- `about.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

You can use this site or add your own files to the `test-site` folder to serve other static content.

## How to Use
### 1. Build and Run
After cloning the repository, open the **SimpleServer** solution in Visual Studio.

1. Build the solution.
2. Run the **SimpleServeGUI** project, which will open a Windows Forms interface.

### 2. Launch the Server
The interface will prompt you to:
- **Choose a path** for your site (by default, the test site is included in the `test-site` folder).
- **Set the port** for your server (default is `8080`, but you can set it to any available port like `80` or `12345`).

Once you click the **Launch** button, the web server will start, and your website will open in your default browser.

## Test Site Example
The test site includes:
- **HTML**: Basic structure with two pages (`index.html` and `about.html`).
- **CSS**: Styling to improve the layout of the pages.
- **JavaScript**: Adds simple interactivity (button click functionality).

Feel free to modify these files or replace them with your own content.
